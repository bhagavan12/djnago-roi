# ‚úÖ FIXED: Full Calculator Free Calculation Count Issue

## üêõ **Problem Identified:**
Users were saving results in the full calculator, but the free calculation count (5) was not decreasing. The count remained at 5 even after multiple full calculator uses.

## üîç **Root Cause:**
The `save_full_results` function in `calculator/views.py` was missing the crucial line to increment the calculation count:

```python
# This line was missing in save_full_results function:
user_limit.increment_calculation_count()
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

### **Fixed in `calculator/views.py`:**
1. **Added user limit retrieval:**
   ```python
   user_limit = get_or_create_user_limit(request.user)
   ```

2. **Added calculation count increment:**
   ```python
   # Increment calculation count (this was missing!)
   user_limit.increment_calculation_count()
   ```

3. **Enhanced response with remaining calculations:**
   ```python
   return JsonResponse({
       'success': True,
       'message': 'Full calculator results saved successfully!',
       'result_id': roi_result.id,
       'remaining_calculations': user_limit.get_remaining_free_calculations()
   })
   ```

## üß™ **How It Works:**

### **Before Fix:**
- User saves full calculator result ‚Üí `save_full_results` called
- ROIResult created in database ‚úÖ
- Calculation count NOT incremented ‚ùå
- Free calculation count stays at 5 ‚ùå

### **After Fix:**
- User saves full calculator result ‚Üí `save_full_results` called
- ROIResult created in database ‚úÖ
- `user_limit.increment_calculation_count()` called ‚úÖ
- `full_calculations_used` incremented by 1 ‚úÖ
- Free calculation count decreases correctly ‚úÖ

## üìä **Business Logic:**

### **Calculation Limits:**
- **Quick Calculations:** Unlimited (no count tracking)
- **Full Calculations:** 5 free calculations per user
- **Admin Users:** Unlimited calculations

### **UserCalculationLimit Model:**
- `full_calculations_used`: Tracks number of full calculations used
- `get_remaining_free_calculations()`: Returns remaining free calculations
- `can_make_calculation()`: Checks if user can make calculation without payment
- `increment_calculation_count()`: Increments the count and saves

## üéØ **Expected Behavior Now:**

1. **New User:** 5 free full calculations available
2. **After 1st Full Calculation:** 4 free calculations remaining
3. **After 2nd Full Calculation:** 3 free calculations remaining
4. **After 3rd Full Calculation:** 2 free calculations remaining
5. **After 4th Full Calculation:** 1 free calculation remaining
6. **After 5th Full Calculation:** 0 free calculations remaining
7. **After 6th Full Calculation:** Payment required

## üîß **Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `calculator/views.py` - Fixed `save_full_results` function

## üß™ **Testing:**
To test the fix:
1. Login as a regular user (not admin)
2. Use the full calculator and save results
3. Check the remaining calculations count
4. Verify it decreases with each saved result

## üéâ **Result:**
The free calculation count now properly decreases when users save full calculator results, ensuring the 5-free-calculations limit works correctly!
