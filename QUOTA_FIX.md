## ðŸŽ‰ Good News!

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed:
- Updated OpenAI library from version 1.51.0 to 1.106.1

## ðŸ’° Current Issue: Quota Exceeded
The chatbot is now working correctly, but you've exceeded your OpenAI quota.

### Error Message:
```
You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

## ðŸš€ How to Fix the Quota Issue:

### Option 1: Add Credits to Your Account
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method or credits
3. Set up usage limits if needed

### Option 2: Use a Different API Key
1. Create a new API key with a different account
2. Update `config.py` with the new key
3. Make sure the new account has credits

### Option 3: Wait for Quota Reset
- Some plans reset monthly
- Check your billing cycle

## ðŸ§ª Test Your Setup:
Once you have credits, test with:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe test_api_key.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Chatbot is Ready!
- The floating robot icon will appear for logged-in users
- Click it to open the AI assistant
- Ask questions about ROI calculations, cloud optimization, etc.

## ðŸ’¡ Cost Tips:
- GPT-3.5-turbo is very affordable (~$0.002 per 1K tokens)
- A simple question costs less than $0.01
- Set usage limits in your OpenAI account to control costs

## ðŸ”’ Security:
- Your API key is stored locally in `config.py`
- Never shared or uploaded anywhere
- All API calls are made server-side for security

The technical issue is resolved - you just need to add credits to your OpenAI account! ðŸš€
