# ✅ FIXED: Payment Redirect to Full Calculator

## 🎯 **Problem Solved:**
After successful payment, users are now properly redirected to the Full Calculator page instead of staying on the payment success page.

## 🔧 **Implementation Details:**

### **1. Backend Fixes (`calculator/views.py`):**

#### **Enhanced Payment Success View:**
```python
@login_required
def payment_success(request):
    """Payment success page - always redirects to full calculator"""
    payment_id = request.GET.get('payment_id')
    if payment_id:
        try:
            payment = Payment.objects.get(payment_id=payment_id, user=request.user)
            # Check if user has unlimited access
            user_limit = get_or_create_user_limit(request.user)
            if user_limit.unlimited_access:
                # Redirect to full calculator with success message
                messages.success(request, '🎉 Payment successful! You now have unlimited access to the Full Calculator.')
                return redirect('full_calculator')
            else:
                # Even if unlimited access is not granted, redirect to full calculator
                # The user will see the payment required message there
                messages.warning(request, 'Payment completed but unlimited access not yet activated. Please try again.')
                return redirect('full_calculator')
        except Payment.DoesNotExist:
            messages.error(request, 'Payment not found.')
            return redirect('full_calculator')
    else:
        messages.error(request, 'No payment ID provided.')
        return redirect('full_calculator')
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **Always Redirects:** Payment success view now always redirects to full calculator
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Even error cases redirect to full calculator
- ✅ **Success Messages:** Appropriate messages are shown based on payment status

### **2. Frontend Fixes:**

#### **Payment Required Template (`templates/calculator/payment_required.html`):**
```javascript
if (data.success) {
    paymentModal.hide();
    // Always redirect to full calculator after successful payment
    if (data.unlimited_access) {
        // Redirect to full calculator with success message
        window.location.href = '/dashboard/full/?unlimited_access=true';
    } else {
        // Still redirect to full calculator, payment success page will handle the redirect
        window.location.href = '/dashboard/payment/success/?payment_id=' + paymentId;
    }
}
```

#### **Full Calculator Template (`templates/calculator/full_calculator.html`):**
```javascript
if (data.success) {
    paymentModal.hide();
    if (data.unlimited_access) {
        // Reload the page to show unlimited access status
        window.location.reload();
    } else {
        // Redirect to payment success page which will redirect to full calculator
        window.location.href = '/dashboard/payment/success/?payment_id=' + paymentId;
    }
}
```

### **3. Enhanced Payment Success Template (`templates/calculator/payment_success.html`):**

#### **Auto-Redirect with Countdown:**
```html
<!-- Auto Redirect Message -->
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <i class="fas fa-clock me-2"></i>
    <strong>Redirecting to Full Calculator in <span id="countdown">5</span> seconds...</strong>
</div>

<!-- Action Buttons -->
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center gap-3">
    <a href="{% url 'full_calculator' %}" class="btn btn-gradient">
        <i class="fas fa-calculator me-2"></i>Go to Full Calculator Now
    </a>
    <a href="{% url 'dashboard_home' %}" class="btn btn-outline-light">
        <i class="fas fa-home me-2"></i>Dashboard
    </a>
</div>
```

#### **Auto-Redirect JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Auto-redirect to full calculator after 5 seconds
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    let countdown = 5;
    const countdownElement = document.getElementById('countdown');
    
    const timer = setInterval(function() {
        countdown--;
        if (countdownElement) {
            countdownElement.textContent = countdown;
        }
        
        if (countdown <= 0) {
            clearInterval(timer);
            // Redirect to full calculator
            window.location.href = "{% url 'full_calculator' %}";
        }
    }, 1000);
    
    // Allow user to cancel auto-redirect by clicking anywhere
    document.addEventListener('click', function() {
        clearInterval(timer);
        if (countdownElement) {
            countdownElement.textContent = 'Cancelled';
        }
    });
});
```
