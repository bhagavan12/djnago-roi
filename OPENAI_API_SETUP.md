# OpenAI API Key Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ Current Status: API Key Not Configured

You need to replace the placeholder API key with your actual OpenAI API key.

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. **Go to OpenAI Platform:**
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up or log in to your account

2. **Create a New API Key:**
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "ROI Calculator Bot")
   - Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`)

3. **Important:** Save the key immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

### Step 2: Configure the API Key

**Option A: Using .env file (Recommended)**

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root
2. Replace the placeholder with your actual key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
   ```

**Option B: Direct configuration in settings.py**

1. Open `roi_calculator/settings.py`
2. Find line 134: `OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY', 'sk-your-openai-api-key-here')`
3. Replace with your actual key:
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY', 'sk-your-actual-key-here')
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Configuration

1. **Restart your Django server:**
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Test the chatbot:**
   - Login to your application
   - Click the floating robot icon
   - Send a test message like "Hello, can you help me with ROI calculations?"

## ðŸ’° Cost Information

- **GPT-3.5-turbo** is very cost-effective
- Typical cost: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
